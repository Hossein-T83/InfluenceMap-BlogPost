# Influence map in game AI

## Abstract

This research is focused on using influence map to help game AI navigate better and act smarter in conclusion of using influence data. Influence map has become a technique that is being used in many games to achieve this goal.

In this article I will break down the impacts of influence map on game ai, different algorithms available and its usage in game industry

## Introduction

### Motivation

Game AI plays an important role when it comes to making player's experience immersive and since nowadays, most games have a kind of game AI such as ai companians, enemies or npcs, it's essential to make these AIs smarter in order to improve player's experience quality. Influence map impacts:

- **Enviromental awareness :** Influence map can be used to increase the ai's awareness by inserting data and summarizing what's happening around them. This helps them with their decision making
- **Prediction :** Influence map can also be used for predicting future events. Like guessing where the player might be based on the last seen position and direction.
- **Memory :** Influence data can be used as some sort of memory where the ai uses the previously inserted data to know what happend and how to act.
